# This is an example configuration file for the task of predicting the control compounds from single cell embeddings. 
# Replacing the paths with your own paths will allow you to run the control task as specified in the README.md. 
# All other parameters are set to the values used in the paper.

seed: 100 # random seed
last_layer: 'encoder.head' # last layer of model to extract embeddings from
num_samples: 100 # number of single cell embeddings to sample from each well 
num_runs: 10 #number of runs for linear probing - each run is an additional subset of the training split, and linear classifier trained with this split
batch_size: 32 # batch size for linear probing
model_dir: add/your/path/here # path to csv file containing model embeddings
controls_dir: add/your/path/here # path which contains control csv files generated by controls/create_controls.py
eval_data_dir: add/your/path/here # path to save csv files containing model embeddings and splits for linear probing
eval_data_file_name: linear_probing # name to tag metric files with
num_epochs: 100 # number of epochs for linear probing
log_dir: add/your/path/here # path to save pytorch lightning logs
metrics_dir: add/your/path/here # path to save metrics
patience: 25 # early stopping patience
model_name: mae # name to tag performance metric files with
plot_save_dir: add/your/path/here # path to save plots
